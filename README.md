# Arduino-Based-Solar-Tracking
In modern solar tracking systems, the solar panels are fixed on a structure that moves according to the position of the sun. This project is a miniature representation of a bigger system and demonstrates the working of a Dual axis Motor. The apparatus designed will efficiently harness the sun’s energy throughout the day and different seasons for maximum power output annually, provided with a solar panel. The system will consist of light sensing components to detect the incident luminance. The pan and tilt motion are achieved with the use of two servo motors and an Arduino controller. The sensor array detects the amount of incident light along each direction. The feedback is given to the controller, which ascertains the sensor receiving a maximum amount of light. Depending on the direction, the controller activates the corresponding servo for either the tilt or the axis rotation movement. In the meantime, the input from the sensors is constantly mapped till the maximum intensity is detected.
